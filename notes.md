What I've done so far:

1. Set-up folder structure
2. Created migrations
3. Created and associated models with `has_secure_password`
(model tests are passing)
4. Added sessions to controller
5. Checked to make sure controller and `Rack::MethodOverride` are in config.ru
6. Created routes to '/', '/login', and '/signup'
7. Created layout view
8. Created index view
